# PDB statistics

The PDB is the main database for structural information on biomolecules. 
Let's see what it contains.

Download a CSV file from the PDB site (accessible from “Analyze” > “PDB Statistics” > “by Experimental Method and Molecular Type”. Move this CSV file into your RStudio project and use it to answer the following questions:

```{r}
db <- read.csv("Data Export Summary.csv", row.names = 1)
db
```

>Q1: What percentage of structures in the PDB are solved by X-Ray and Electron Microscopy.

```{r}
sum_comma <- function(x) {
  #substitute the comma and voncert to numeric
  sum(as.numeric(gsub(",","", x)))
}
```

For X-ray
```{r}
#Thus the percentage of X-ray is
round(sum_comma(db$X.ray) / sum_comma(db$Total),2)
```

For EM
```{r}
#The percentage of EM
round(sum_comma(db$EM) / sum_comma(db$Total),2)
```

>Q2: What proportion of structures in the PDB are protein?

```{r}
round(sum_comma(db$Total[1])/sum_comma(db$Total),2)
```

>Q3: Type HIV in the PDB website search box on the home page and determine how many HIV-1 protease structures are in the current PDB?

SKIPPED!

>Q6: Generate and save a figure clearly showing the two distinct chains of HIV-protease along with the ligand. You might also consider showing the catalytic residues ASP 25 in each chain and the critical water (we recommend “Ball & Stick” for these side-chains). Add this figure to your Quarto document.

>Q4: Water molecules normally have 3 atoms. Why do we see just one atom per water molecule in this structure?

The structure is too low a resolution to see H atoms. You need a sub 1 Angstrom resolution to see Hydrogen.

>Q5: There is a critical “conserved” water molecule in the binding site. Can you identify this water molecule? What residue number does this water molecule have

HOH308

# Working with Structures in R

We can use the `bio3d` package to read and perform bioinformatics calculations on PDB structures

```{r}
library(bio3d)

pdb <- read.pdb("1hsg")
pdb
```

>Q7: How many amino acid residues are there in this pdb object? 

198

>Q8: Name one of the two non-protein residues? 

HOH (127), MK1 (1)

>Q9: How many protein chains are in this structure? 

2

```{r}
attributes(pdb)
```

```{r}
head(pdb$atom)
```

Read an ADK structure

```{r}
adk <- read.pdb("6s36")
adk
```

Perform a prediciton of flexibility with a technique called NMA (Normal mode analysis)

```{r}
# Perform flexiblity prediction
m <- nma(adk)
plot(m)
```

Write out a "movie" of the motion for viewing in MOlstar

```{r}
mktrj(m, file="adk_m7.pdb")
```
